******Voice Assistant - GPT-2 Language Model Training******

 This project focuses on training a GPT-2 model using custom data for a voice assistant. The
 goal is to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on your data (e.g., a large dataset of
 conversational or assistant-like interactions) to improve the model's ability to generate
 natural responses.

** Project Overview**
 This project involves fine-tuning GPT-2, a pre-trained language model, on custom datasets.
 The model is trained to generate responses that could be used in a voice assistant
 application. GPT-2's capabilities allow it to generate coherent, context-aware text, making it
 suitable for dialogue-based tasks such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or interactive systems.

 The training process includes:
   
 a. Data preprocessing and tokenization.
 b. Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model on the custom dataset.
 c. Setting up the training loop using Hugging Face's transformers library.
 d. Evaluating the model's performance.
 
****Installation Instructions****
**Step 1: Install Dependencies** --->>>

--->>>Clone the repository to your local machine:

 bash--->>>
 git clone [https://github.com/deepak22iitk/voice-assistant-gpt2.git](https://github.com/deepak22iitk/DIY-Projects.git)--->>>
 cd voice-assistant-gpt2--->>>
 
 Install the necessary dependencies using --->>>
 bash--->>>
 pip :--->>>
 pip install -r requirements.txt--->>>
 
 **Step 2: Install Required Libraries**--->>>
 In addition to the standard dependencies, make sure the following libraries are installed:--->>>
 
 bash--->>>
 pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate--->>>
 If you're using GPUs for training, ensure that you have the necessary CUDA setup for
 PyTorch.--->>>
 
 **Step 3: Install Tokenizers**
 The tokenizers library is necessary for efficient tokenization. It can be installed by running:
 bash
 pip install tokenizers
 
 D**ataset Preparation**
 The dataset is expected to be in a JSON Lines (
 .jsonl ) format, with each entry containing a
 "prompt" and a "completion" (the response). The format should look like this:
 
 json
{"prompt": "How are you?", "completion": "I'm doing great, thank you!"}
 Your dataset can be divided into two files: 
testing.
 train.jsonl for training and 
test.jsonl for
 train.jsonl : Contains the majority of the training data.
 test.jsonl : Contains a smaller subset used for model evaluation.
 
 **Example Dataset Structure:**
 train.jsonl :
 json
 {"prompt": "Hello, how can I help you today?", "completion": "Hi, I need help 
with my account."}
 {"prompt": "What is your name?", "completion": "I'm a virtual assistant."}
 test.jsonl :
 json
 {"prompt": "What's the weather like today?", "completion": "It's sunny and 
warm!"}
 {"prompt": "Tell me a joke.", "completion": "Why don’t skeletons fight each 
other? They don’t have the guts."}
 Ensure that the files are in the same directory as the script.

 
** **Model Training****

 **Step 1: Tokenize the Dataset**
 The data is tokenized using the GPT-2 tokenizer, which is available from Hugging Face's
 transformers library. The tokenizer splits the input text into tokens that GPT-2 can
 understand. We also pad and truncate sequences to the same length for efficient batch
 processing.

**Step 2: Define the Model**
We use the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face’s model hub and fine-tune it on the
 custom dataset. The model used here is a causal language model, meaning it predicts the
 next word given the previous ones.
 
 python
 
 from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
 tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
 model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
 training_args = TrainingArguments(
 output_dir="./results",
 num_train_epochs=3,
 per_device_train_batch_size=4,
 per_device_eval_batch_size=4,
 save_steps=1000,
 eval_steps=1000,
 logging_dir="./logs",
 logging_steps=100,
 evaluation_strategy="epoch",
 load_best_model_at_end=True,
 )
 trainer = Trainer(
 model=model,
 args=training_args,
 train_dataset=train_dataset,
 eval_dataset=test_dataset,
 tokenizer=tokenizer,
 data_collator=DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False),
 )
 
 **Step 3: Train the Model**
 Use the following command to start training:
 
 bash
 python train_gpt2.py
 
 This will start the training process. During training, the model learns to predict the next
 token in a sequence based on the input. You will be able to monitor the training progress via
 the logs.

 **Step 4: Save the Model**
 The trained model will be saved in the 
 output_dir specified in the 
 TrainingArguments . You can then load the model later for inference or further fine-tuning.
 
 python
 model.save_pretrained("./gpt2_finetuned")
 tokenizer.save_pretrained("./gpt2_finetuned")
 
 **Usage**
 After training, you can use the fine-tuned model to generate responses for new prompts.
 Here’s an example of how to use the model for inference:
 
 python
 
 @from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
 
 # Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer
 
 model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("./gpt2_finetuned")
 tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("./gpt2_finetuned")
 
 # Generate a response to a prompt
 prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
 inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
 outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
 
 # Decode the response
 response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
 print(response)
 This code generates a response to the input prompt using the fine-tuned model.
 
**Future Work**
Data Augmentation: Improve the dataset by adding more diverse interactions and
 scenarios.
 Model Optimization: Experiment with smaller versions of GPT, such as GPT-2 small, for
 faster inference and reduced resource usage.
 Voice Integration: Integrate the fine-tuned model into a voice assistant system for real
time interaction.
